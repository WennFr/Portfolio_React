## üìÉDescription
Hi! This is my portfolio application! In the main project "portfolio-site" created in React, you can find background about me, my resume and projects I've been working on. If you want to get in touch with me you can find my contact information under "Kontakt". The portfolio project also includes a .NET API application responsible for providing details about my public GitHub projects. The API is consumed by the main project which displays the information under the "Portfolio" section in the main project. The main project consumes an external Weather API that displays the current local weather in realtime. For more information about the weather api used, visit: https://open-meteo.com/. The purpose of this project is to introduce myself and showcase my experience as a .NET developer. On my portfolio site you can access applications that I have developed and follow my progression. Feel free to contact me!


## :computer: Commands
npm start  - start application in Visual Studio Code.

npm install - download necessary node_modules folder needed for starting the application. Do this first if you intend to run the project locally.



## üõ†Ô∏è Implementations
The main project is developed in React and is structured using react components. All styling is done by me and is implemented using SCSS. For responsive design, the project is reliant on media querys to fit different screen sizes. The project uses vanilla JavaScript for handling certain tasks such as fetching API:s, handle click events and scrolling functions. The API is a .NET Web API with one endpoint that returns all project information.
